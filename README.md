# DesignPatterns.AbstractFactory
This is a demonstration from my DesignPattern series.

This app simulates the presentation of different furniture sets based on their type.
This example is not that useful in a real world scenario, but this way I found it extremely easy to understand and practice with.

Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
